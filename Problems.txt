1] While scraping Flipkart website, faced problem when structure of arrangement of product changes on webpages. Solved it by handling both structure of arrangement. There are 4 products in a row or 1 product in a row.


try:
   results = soup.find_all('div', {'class':'_2pi5LC col-12-12'})
   if len(results) == 0:
      results = soup.find_all('div', {'class':'_1AtVbE col-12-12'})
except AttributeError:
   pass
